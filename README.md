### Core Features

#### Gitset MCP (Model Context Protocol)
The next generation of Gitset development tools, currently in active development. Gitset MCP will unify all 9 platform capabilities into a single, intelligent agent that works seamlessly with your terminal and IDE. This revolutionary approach brings commit message generation, README creation, issue crafting, and all other tools directly to your development environment with advanced context awareness and team preference learning.

**Key MCP Features:**
- **Unified Experience**: All 9 tools accessible from a single interface
- **IDE Integration**: Native integration with popular IDEs like Cursor, VS Code, and more
- **Smart Context**: Advanced AI that understands your project context, coding patterns, and team preferences
- **Cross-Platform Token System**: Shared usage limits between web and local tools

#### Token-Based Usage System
Gitset operates on a fair, transparent token-based system that measures actual AI processing complexity rather than simple request counts:

**Usage Plans:**
- **Basic Plan**: 300,000 tokens/month (~120 operations) - **FREE**

#### Token System & Payment Processing:

#### Lemon Squeezy Integration & Token Tracking
The token system implements a comprehensive usage management mechanism that operates across multiple layers:

- **Token Processing Layer:**
  - Handles subscription management and payment processing via Lemon Squeezy
  - Real-time token consumption tracking with granular analytics
  - Cross-platform token sharing between web tools and future MCP agent

- **Usage Analytics (Turso Database):**
  - High-performance token tracking with 3x faster validation queries
  - Real-time consumption monitoring per tool and user
  - Usage analytics and reporting for dashboard display
  - Token limits enforced per service and plan tier

- **Request Flow:**
  1. Backend validates user plan tier (`basic`/`pro`/`enterprise`) via authentication token.
  2. Token validator checks remaining quota in real-time.
  3. Request processed if token quota allows.
  4. Token consumption updated atomically after successful processing.
  5. Usage analytics updated for dashboard display.

- **Plan Tiers:**
  - **Basic Plan**: 300,000 tokens/month (~120 operations) - FREE
  - **Pro Plan**: 1,000,000 tokens/month (~400 operations) - $2.99/month
  - **Enterprise Plan**: 10,000,000 tokens/month (~4,000 operations) - $19.99/month

- **Security Considerations:**
  - Token tracking integrated with authentication system
  - Secure usage analytics with atomic updates
  - Plan validation occurs at multiple system layers

### Technical Considerations
- **Scalability**: The system ensures horizontal scalability with independent scaling of AI processing units, as well as the distributed handling of public and protected service layers. Token tracking system designed for high-throughput operations.
  
- **Security**: The authentication gateway serves as the primary security checkpoint with integrated token validation. OAuth-based authentication ensures secure user identification and session management with real-time usage monitoring.
  
- **Performance**: The use of parallel AI processing, combined with Turso database for fast token validation, ensures efficient processing and delivery. Public and protected services are optimized for minimal latency with smart token management.

- **Integration Points**: 
  - Integration with GitHub for authentication and API access.
  - Gemini AI services for advanced content generation and analysis.
  - **Turso Database**: High-performance database for token tracking and user management.
  - **Template System**: Custom template storage and management across multiple tools.
  - Python backend (FastAPI and Flask): Handles template-based processing and AI-driven request handling.
  - SSR frontend with real-time token usage display and analytics.
