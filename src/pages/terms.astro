                            <p style="max-width: none !important;"><strong>Gitset.dev</strong> is a comprehensive suite of AI-driven tools that enhances your GitHub development experience. It provides solutions for streamlined repository management, precise versioning, clear documentation, commit message generation, issue crafting, pull request management, code decommenting, and dependency handling. The platform integrates 9 Python-based backends with AI-powered suggestions and operates on a flexible token-based usage system. Access to certain features may require authentication via OAuth, where users may choose to grant access to their GitHub account. However, some features remain accessible without authentication. Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their authentication credentials.</p>
                            
                            <h3>3. OAuth Authentication and User Responsibilities</h3>
                        
                            <p style="max-width: none !important;"><strong>Gitset.dev</strong> utilizes OAuth authentication to allow Users to access their GitHub repositories and perform specific tasks related to their repositories. By authenticating through OAuth, Users grant <strong>Gitset.dev</strong> access to their GitHub account, but only to the extent required for the operation of the requested features.</p>
                            
                            <p style="font-weight: 600; max-width: none !important;">

Gitset.dev is not liable for any issues arising from the use of processed code.
                            </p>

                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">
                                <strong>Dependencies Handler:</strong> Streamlines dependency management across multiple programming languages including Python, Java, C/C++, and Rust.

                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">
                                <strong>Gitset.dev</strong> operates on a fair, transparent token-based system that measures actual AI processing complexity rather than simple request counts. These Supplemental Token Terms form part of this agreement and govern the purchase, usage, and management of tokens within the Gitset.dev platform.
                            </p>

                            <h4>A. Types of Tokens</h4>

                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">
                                <strong>1. Usage Tokens.</strong> Unless otherwise agreed to between User and Gitset.dev, Gitset.dev may require User to subscribe to plans that include predetermined token allocations sufficient to cover User's usage according to our pricing structure. User's subscription constitutes an offer by User to purchase those tokens. Gitset.dev will notify User upon successful subscription activation.
                            </p>

                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">
                                <strong>2. Promotional Tokens.</strong> Gitset.dev may, in its sole discretion, offer User free tokens as part of a promotion, during sign up for the Services, or as compensation for service disruptions.
                            </p>

                            <h4>B. Token Terms and Conditions</h4>

                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">
                                <strong>1. Non-Refundable.</strong> Tokens issued by Gitset.dev, which includes Usage Tokens, Promotional Tokens, and any other tokens Gitset.dev offers, are <strong>non-refundable</strong>. Usage Tokens reset monthly according to the subscription billing cycle. Promotional Tokens expire at the time indicated when issued (or otherwise one calendar year from when issued if no time is specified). Tokens will also automatically forfeit if User closes their Gitset.dev account and cannot be recovered. Tokens are not legal tender or currency of any kind and have no cash value. User can check their subscription details and general account information on the Dashboard page. Real-time token consumption tracking, including tokens consumed per operation, session totals, cumulative usage, and remaining token balance, is displayed directly within each tool after every AI operation to ensure complete transparency.
                            </p>

                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">
                                <strong>2. No Transfer.</strong> User may not transfer or sell tokens, whether paid for or provided as part of a promotion, to any other person or entity, and tokens may only be used by the holder of the Gitset.dev account to which the tokens are associated.
                            </p>

                            <p style="max-width: none !important;">
